You can choose which exercise you want to read.
Here's my advice:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Something valuable, cost my energy and time,
you may spent at least 30 minutes to read any of them:
------------
ex-1.03.rkt
ex-1.10.rkt
------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Something little ones, but interesting,
you may spent 10 to 30 minutes to read any of them:
------------
ex-1.04.rkt
ex-1.05.rkt
------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Well, if you just want to find an solution of it,
just pick whatever you want to read.
